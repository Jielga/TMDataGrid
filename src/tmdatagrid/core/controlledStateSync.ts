/**
 * Timing repair for TanStack's controlled-state sync.
 *
 * `useTable` calls `table.setOptions` from its render body, and that syncs
 * `options.state` into the table's atoms. An atom write publishes the store
 * synchronously, so every component subscribed to `table.store` schedules a
 * setState while the consumer's component is still rendering - which React
 * reports as "Cannot update a component (X) while rendering a different
 * component (Y)", pointing at the consumer's component rather than at the
 * grid.
 *
 * The write has to stay where it is: the atoms must hold the controlled value
 * before the table builds its row models for that render. Only the
 * notification is early, so it moves to a microtask. `getSnapshot` already
 * returns the new value, so a component reads the same state either way; the
 * subscription is only what schedules a re-render for the components the
 * consumer's own render does not reach.
