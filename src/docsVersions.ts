 * Which copy of the documentation this is, and what else is deployed beside

 *
 * The site is published as several complete builds under one Pages root: the
 * latest stable release at the root, the tip of main at `next/`, one directory
 * per minor line at `v1.1/`, and labelled pull request previews at
 * `b/<branch>/`. Each build is compiled against its own `--base`, so switching
 * version is a full page load to another bundle, never a router navigation.
 *
 * The identity of a copy is stamped at build time, unlike the registry figures
 * in `packageStatus.ts`: a build genuinely is one version's documentation for
 * ever, and asking a server which one it is would be asking a question the
 * bundle already answers.
