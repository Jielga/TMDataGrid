# Editors and validation

Which control a cell opens when editing starts, what the value becomes on the
way in, and what prevents a bad one being committed. All three follow from the
column: `meta.type` picks the editor, and `meta.edit` holds the rest.

```demo
file: editing/EditorsAndValidation.tsx
hint: Type a single letter into String, or 5 into Number, to see validation reject it.

## The built-in editors

`meta.type` picks one, and `meta.options` feeds the select editors from the same
source the filter panel reads. Neither lives under `meta.edit`.

| `meta.type` | Editor | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `string` (default) | Text input | `string` |
| `number` | Number input | `number`, or `null` while the cell is empty or the text is not yet a number |
| `boolean` | Checkbox | `boolean` |
| `date` | Native `<input type="date">` | A `Date`, or the `"YYYY-MM-DD"` string; `null` when cleared |
| `select` | Searchable select from `meta.options`. Commits on pick under `"cell"` | `string \| null` |
| `multiSelect` | Multi-select, same source | `string[]` |

**Writes** is the value the editor puts into the draft: what `meta.edit.mapValue` is handed, what `meta.edit.validate` checks, and what a commit carries in `value` and in `changes[].next`.

The number editor writes `null` rather than `NaN` while the text does not parse, so a half-typed number leaves the field empty instead of committing a number no rule can describe.
The date editor picks between its two types once, when it opens, from what the cell held: a `Date` cell keeps receiving `Date`s and a string cell keeps receiving `"YYYY-MM-DD"` strings, so clearing and retyping cannot flip the type.

Each is a named export (`TMDataGridStringEditor`, `TMDataGridNumberEditor`,
`TMDataGridBooleanEditor`, `TMDataGridDateEditor`, `TMDataGridSelectEditor`,
`TMDataGridMultiSelectEditor`), so a custom editor can wrap one instead of
starting from scratch.

## Writing your own

`meta.edit.editor` fills the same slot as the built-ins. It is a **component**,
rendered as JSX, so hooks may be used inside, and it receives the live TanStack
Form `field` API. Bind any control to it as you would inside a form:

```tsx
const SalaryEditor: TMDataGridEditorComponent = ({ field, commit }) => (
  <Slider
    value={field.state.value}
    onChange={field.handleChange}
    onChangeEnd={() => void commit()}
  />
);

meta: { edit: { editor: SalaryEditor } }
```

**Define editors at module scope.** An inline arrow function gets a new identity
on every render, which remounts the editor mid-edit and discards what was typed.

The field's validation message is shown by the host, in a tooltip on the
editor: open while the input is focused, and on hover. A custom editor gets the
same tooltip, so it renders no message of its own.

The built-in editors mark the input invalid and add no inline text, since the
message would be clipped by the width of the cell. A custom editor does the
same by binding a boolean to the control's `error` prop:

```tsx
const hasError = field.state.meta.errors.length > 0;

<Slider value={field.state.value} onChange={field.handleChange} error={hasError} />;
```

## Mapping the value as it is typed

A column can rewrite every value on its way into the draft: uppercase a code,
strip spaces out of an IBAN, clamp a number into range. `meta.edit.mapValue`
runs on each write an editor makes, which is each keystroke for a text input and
each pick for a select.

```demo
file: editing/MappedInput.tsx
hint: Type into either column. Code uppercases, Reference keeps digits only.
height: 420
```

```tsx
meta: {
  edit: {
    mapValue: ({ value }) =>
      typeof value === "string" ? value.toUpperCase() : value,
  },
}
```

What it returns is what the cell shows, what the validators check and what is
committed.

The map is applied inside the editor host, around the field every editor writes
through, so one declaration covers all six built-in editors, your own
`meta.edit.editor`, and the character that opened the editor when typing started
the edit.

Some writes are not mapped: the value the editor opens with, and the writes that go through the form rather than through an editor - `edit.clearCell()`, the Delete key, `edit.setCellValue()` and `edit.setRowValues()`.
An editor calling `field.setValue` instead of `field.handleChange` also bypasses the map.
`handleChange` is the mapped path.

The map receives the row and column as well, so it can depend on the record
being edited:

```tsx
meta: {
  edit: {
    mapValue: ({ value, row }) =>
      row.original.country === "SE" && typeof value === "string"
        ? value.replace(/ /g, "")
        : value,
  },
}
```

`previous` is the value the field held before this write, which a mask needs in
order to tell an insertion from a deletion.

### Keeping the caret

A mapped value differs from the one the input holds, so React writes the new
value into the DOM node and the browser collapses the selection to the end of
the field.

The built-in string and number editors restore the caret to where it was typed,
shifted by however much the map changed the length, so a mask that inserts or
strips characters keeps the caret beside the same text.

A custom editor rendering its own input has the same problem, and solves it the
same way: record `selectionStart` as the value is handed over, and restore it in
a layout effect once the mapped value has rendered.

## Validation

The validators are TanStack Form's own: a Standard Schema (Zod, Valibot,
ArkType) or a plain function returning an error message or nothing.

```tsx
// Per column: field-level validators. A bare schema or function means { onChange: it }.
meta: { edit: { validate: z.string().min(2, "Too short") } }

// The same rule without a schema library:
meta: {
  edit: {
    validate: ({ value }: { value: unknown }) =>
      typeof value === "string" && value.length < 2 ? "Too short" : undefined,
  },
}

// Per row: form-level validators - cross-field rules live here.
useTMDataGrid({
  editing: {
    mode: "cell",
    rowValidators: {
      onSubmit: z.object({ salary: z.number().positive() })
        .refine((r) => r.status !== "Terminated" || r.salary === 0, {
          message: "A terminated employee has no salary",
        }),
    },
  },
});
```

A plain function is typed `TMDataGridValidator`, whose `value` is `never`, so annotate the parameter - `{ value: unknown }`, or the type the column's editor writes - rather than leaving it to be inferred.

Pathed issues land on the matching cells; pathless ones on the row, where the
message shows in the edit lane's tooltip - on the open row's ✓, and on the
parked row's marker. To show a pathless message somewhere of your own, read it
from `edit.getForm(rowId)?.state.errors`; `edit.store` carries the flag
(`hasRowError`) and the field messages (`errorMessages`), not the row text.

A commit blocked by validation keeps the editor open, invalid, with the message
in its tooltip. A rejected `editing.onCommit` keeps the draft too, with the
error on the row. Server-side field errors can be returned natively through
`editing.rowValidators.onSubmitAsync`'s `{ form, fields }` shape.

Cross-field rules need a mode that commits the whole row at once. Under
`"cell"` each cell commits alone, so a rule spanning two columns cannot be
satisfied by either one. Use `editing.rowValidators.onSubmit` with `"row"`. See
[Editing](/docs/editing#row-editing).

A rule about the whole collection, such as "no duplicates" or "shares sum to
100", is neither a field rule nor a row rule. It takes
`editing.tableValidators` - see [Cross-row rules](#cross-row-rules).

## Cross-row rules

`editing.tableValidators` holds the rules that need the other rows: no
duplicate keys, no overlapping ranges, allocations summing to a total. Its
validators receive the committing row and `rows`, the collection as it would
stand if the commit landed - every draft overlaid, entry rows appended,
deletion-marked rows removed:

```tsx
editing: {
  mode: "cell",
  draft: true,
  tableValidators: {
    onSubmit: ({ value, rowId, rows }) =>
      rows.some((r) => r.rowId !== rowId && r.value.code === value.code)
        ? { fields: { code: "Codes must be unique" } }
        : undefined,
  },
}
```

The result is the `rowValidators` vocabulary: nothing passes, a string is a
row-level message, and `{ form, fields }` lands pathed issues on the
committing row's cells. `onSubmit` runs first, and its failure stands without
`onSubmitAsync` running.

The rules run at every commit, after the row's own validators, and again for
every parked row during `saveDrafts` - a draft that a later edit has
invalidated fails there, keeps its markers, and the save resolves `false`.
Errors land on the committing row only; the row it clashes with is not
marked.

`rows` is unfiltered, so a rule sees the whole collection whatever the view
shows, and it never contains group rows.

```demo
file: editing/TableValidation.tsx
hint: Give two teams the same code, or push the shares past 100, and the commit is refused. Drafts count - a clash with a pending edit is caught too.
height: 380
```

A grid inside an outer form can put collection rules in the form's own field
validator instead. See [A query builder form](/docs/query-builder).
