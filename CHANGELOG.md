## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/pull/7) [`254709d`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/254709d01df66936bedf1b2ac11bcc45eda13f5a) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Filter panel: a "Filters" header with a close button, Escape and a click outside
  to dismiss, and a "Clear all" next to "Add filter", which is now disabled once
  every filterable column has a filter.

  New `TMDataGrid.FilterPills` (also exported as `TMDataGridFilterPills`) — one
  pill per active filter, `First name: Sofia ✕`, with the ✕ clearing that filter
  and a click on the label reopening the panel on its column. It takes the grid as
  an `api` prop instead of reading context, so it can be rendered outside the
  grid. `formatFilterLabel` is exported for building your own.

- [#6](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/pull/6) [`9f39544`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/9f39544ac48f8fc1f20e656aa79ebe9d364ab719) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Add `rowContextMenu` to `TMDataGrid.Table`: a render prop that fills a Mantine
  `Menu` the grid opens at the pointer on a right-click or long press. It receives
  `{ table, row, cell, close }`, and returning `null` leaves a row without a menu.
  `rowContextMenuProps` passes through to the `Menu`. The open row carries
  `data-context-menu`.

- [#7](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/pull/7) [`040e4b3`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/040e4b3f49c2f1f7be285ee299a568629d7bce88) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Row grouping. **Group by X** in any column menu collapses the rows into a tree;
  the grouped column leaves the grid and a generated **Group** column takes its
  place, pinned beside the checkbox lane, showing each group's value, its record
  count and a chevron. Group from a second menu to nest. **Ungroup** lives on the
  tree column's menu, and **Expand/Collapse all groups** in every column menu. On
  by default, off under `manualPagination`; `enableGrouping: false` disables it.

  Aggregation is opt-in — a group row is blank until a column declares an
  `aggregationFn`. A group's checkbox selects every record under it at any depth,
  and only the records reach `rowSelection`. `grouping` persists with the settings
  slices, `expanded` with the data slices.

  Grouping suspends the built-in pager, which greys itself out rather than
  disappearing: a page cannot count both rows and groups without stranding part of
  the tree. `isPagingActive` is exported for custom pagers.

  Also fixes a hidden column leaving an empty grid track behind, from the column
  tracks being built from all leaf columns while the cells came from the visible
  ones.

- [#4](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/pull/4) [`f947272`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/f947272d7db6bcf78464050a89359f96ce57bacc) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Add `selectionMode`, replacing `rowSelectionMode`: `"checkbox"` (the default),
  `"row"`, `"checkboxAndHighlight"` and `"highlight"`. The last two introduce a
  highlighted row — state of its own, so a checkbox multi-selection and a single
  highlighted row can coexist for a detail panel. Row-click selection gains the
  usual Ctrl/Shift modifiers, and the select-all box is dropped under
  `enableMultiRowSelection: false`, where it selected every row.

  Breaking renames:

  - `rowSelectionMode` → `selectionMode` (`"checkbox"` and `"row"` unchanged)
  - `highlightSelectedRows` → `showSelectedBackground`
  - `data-highlighted` → `data-selected-bg`; `data-highlighted` now marks the
    highlighted row
  - New `--dg-row-highlight-bg` alongside `--dg-row-selected-bg`

### Patch Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/pull/7) [`620a739`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/620a739e10f3d73e77c5bd61aafd73721d4d226a) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Fix the checkbox being clipped in the select column at `size="xl"`. The column
  is a fixed 48px track, which the cell padding — 18px a side at `xl` — left too
  little room for. It no longer takes that padding and centres its box instead.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c98a857`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/c98a85747a03b8cfc36aa859aa40a61190f320e9) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Make pagination opt-in via `enablePagination` (implied by `manualPagination`);
  by default all rows render, virtualized. `TMDataGrid.Footer` gains a
  `pagination` render prop for custom pagers.

- [`c98a857`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/c98a85747a03b8cfc36aa859aa40a61190f320e9) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Add `rowSelectionMode`. `"checkbox"` (the default) keeps the checkbox column;
  `"row"` drops it and toggles a row on click. `highlightSelectedRows` controls
  the selected-row background and follows the mode. Fixes the selection
  checkboxes not re-rendering when a row was selected.

### Patch Changes

- [`20c68ee`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/20c68eeaa7d4ba9034f1c49b59ac253619da9e8b) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Debounce persistence writes so a column resize no longer writes to storage on
  every pointer move, and drop restored state that fails a shape check instead of
  feeding it to the table. The footer's page-size Select now keeps a current size
  that is not in `pageSizeOptions` rather than rendering blank, and headers expose
  `aria-sort` alongside `aria-rowcount` / `aria-colcount` / `aria-rowindex` on the
  virtualized grid.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`e8090a4`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/e8090a480f1fd944edecace2fd7d415b20b84244) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Add column reordering. Drag a header to move a column, or move it a step at a
  time from the column menu. Order is respected per pinned region and persists
  through the `columnOrder` slice.

- [`280baf8`](https://github.com/Jielga/TMDataGrid/commit/280baf89e98c6cd5be087273c6532d3df3dcce3a) Thanks [@Psvensso](https://github.com/Psvensso)! - Ship agent skills with the package via TanStack Intent. Five skills under
  `skills/` — getting started, columns, options, features and server-side data —
  are published in the tarball, so coding agents read current guidance for the
  installed version straight from `node_modules` instead of relying on whatever
  their training data happened to include.
