# jielga/react

The bun workspaces monorepo for the `@jielga` React packages, each published on npm on its own.
`packages/<name>/` is a library with its docs and skills, `apps/` holds the sites that render them, and `scripts/` is the tooling they share.

- `@jielga/tmdatagrid` - a React data grid built on TanStack Table v9 (beta) and Mantine v9; `apps/docs/` is its site.
- `@jielga/tmdatagrid-xlsx` - xlsx export for the grid.
- `@jielga/react-popup-window` - a hook that renders part of the UI in a separate browser window; `apps/popup-docs/` is its demo site.

Most of this file is about the grid, because that is where the rules were learned; the workspace, test, docs and release rules hold for every package.

## Where work is tracked

Start here after a break, or on a cold session:

- The GitHub issues of `Jielga/react` - `gh issue list` is the backlog, and an issue is the only place item status lives.
  `held` marks planned work waiting on the stakeholder's go, `icebox` a known gap with no decision to build; an issue without either label is cleared.
  Close the issue from the pull request that ships it, and put what shipped in the changeset, not in a file here.

Do not start held or iceboxed work without the stakeholder's go.

`plans/` is gitignored. Working notes may live there, but they stay local and nothing committed may depend on them.

## Commands

All from the repository root.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Grid docs site: docs, examples, playground (`bun run --cwd apps/<app> dev` for another site: `popup-docs`, `docs-home`) |
| `bun run test` | Vitest once, every workspace project (`test:watch` to iterate) |
| `bun run test:e2e` | Playwright, Chromium: the grid docs-site specs, the component specs, the popup demo specs and the index page specs (`--project=docs`, `components`, `popup` or `home` for one of them) |
| `bun run lint` | oxlint - types are **not** checked here |
| `bun run check:skills` | `intent validate` over every package's `skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc -b` over every project |
| `bun run build:lib` | Every published package into its `dist/` |
| `bun run build:docs` | Every docs site and the index page, each into its `apps/<app>/dist/` |
| `bun run build` | Both |

The pre-commit hook runs lint, both checks above, the typecheck, the changeset check, and `build:lib` when a `packages/*/src/` path changed.
Run those before committing rather than discovering them at the hook.

Run intent through `scripts/intent.mjs`, never `npx intent`.
Two installed packages declare a bin by that name and the one that wins is an install-order accident; the wrong one crashes on startup.

Driving a browser by hand through the Playwright MCP tools is expensive.
Use it deliberately, not as a way to look around; a spec under `playwright/` is the cheap way to check behaviour in a browser.

## The workspace

Shared dependency versions live in the root `package.json` `catalog`; a package declares `"catalog:"` and the root decides the version.
Peer dependency ranges of a published package stay literal - they are policy, not the installed version.

The site depends on `@jielga/tmdatagrid` by name, as a user does, and resolves it to source: `apps/docs/vite.alias.ts` for Vite and Vitest, `paths` in `apps/docs/tsconfig.json` for TypeScript.
The published manifest knows nothing of this.
A new package that tests against the grid copies that pair; its declaration build must not, so that the grid resolves to the published `dist/index.d.ts` and stays external in its dts rollup.

`@jielga/tmdatagrid` and `@jielga/tmdatagrid-xlsx` form one changesets `fixed` group: one version, released together, each package published on its own.
Every other published package is versioned on its own.
The xlsx package has a peer dependency on the grid, and changesets majors a peer dependent on any minor of its peer unless `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` is on; the config sets it, so a minor of the grid stays a minor for the group.
A private package never carries the `@jielga/` scope (the docs apps are `tmdatagrid-docs`, `react-popup-window-docs`, `docs-shell` and `docs-home`), so no changesets glob can ever pull it into a release.
In pre mode `changeset version` crashes on any fixed-group member missing from `.changeset/pre.json`, so a package added to the group during a prerelease wave goes into `initialVersions` there before the next `chore: version packages` run.

## The library boundary

`packages/tmdatagrid/src/index.ts` is the only entry point the package exposes.
An export added there is public API: it needs docs and a changeset, and it cannot quietly change again.

Nothing but the library and its `*.test.ts(x)` files may live under `packages/tmdatagrid/src/` - the test harness (`gridHarness.tsx`, `fixtures.tsx`), the Playwright gallery and the stories live in `packages/tmdatagrid/test/`, which keeps them out of the tarball and the declaration build.

Peer dependencies stay external in `packages/tmdatagrid/vite.config.ts`.
Bundling `react`, `@mantine/*` or `@tanstack/*` hands the consumer a second copy of the React runtime, the Mantine theme context or the TanStack feature registry, and each fails at runtime rather than at build time.

The `tmdatagrid` CSS layer name in `styles.layer.css` is public API - never rename it.

## Conventions specific to this repo

Styling is co-located CSS Modules (`Component.module.css`), not Emotion.

TanStack Table v9 is beta and the grid uses its feature-registry API; check `useTMDataGrid.tsx` before assuming a v8 shape carries over.

The React Compiler runs in both Vite configs and in the Playwright gallery but not under Vitest, so a jsdom component test proves the wiring, not the memoization; a Playwright spec sees the compiled output.

The grid publishes `data-dg-part` plus `data-row-id` / `data-column-id`, and no `data-testid` of its own.
Roles flip from `table`/`cell` to `grid`/`gridcell` when cell selection is on.
Renaming or dropping a part breaks a documented contract - see [testing.md](packages/tmdatagrid/docs/testing.md).

## Tests

Vitest and React Testing Library in jsdom, co-located as `*.test.ts(x)`.
Use the harness in [gridHarness.tsx](packages/tmdatagrid/test/gridHarness.tsx) - `renderGridUi`, `part()`, `gridRowCount()` - rather than re-deriving selectors.

Two jsdom facts decide how a grid test has to be written:

- There is no layout, so the virtualizer mounts a handful of rows whatever the data says.
  Assert on `aria-rowcount` / `data-dg-row-count`, never on the number of row elements.
- Mantine transitions never settle, so a popover panel mounts empty outside `<MantineProvider env="test">`.
  The harness sets it; a bespoke render has to as well.

[demos.test.tsx](apps/docs/src/examples/demos.test.tsx) mounts every demo, fails on any `console.error`, and checks that every demo fence, topic link and docs link resolves.
A broken demo or a dead link fails the suite, so run the tests after touching docs or examples, not just after touching code.

Playwright covers what jsdom cannot, in Chromium, from `bun run test:e2e`; the config is [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts).

- [playwright/docs/](playwright/docs) drives the docs demos through the `DataGrid` page object in [DataGrid.ts](playwright/support/DataGrid.ts).
  Every spec there is a template a consumer copies into their own suite, so it uses parts and coordinates, never text, and never counts row elements.
  A demo is reached by `data-demo="<file>"` on its `DemoBlock`.
- [playwright/components/](playwright/components) mounts stories from `packages/tmdatagrid/test/stories/` through the gallery in `packages/tmdatagrid/test/gallery/`.
  `bun run --cwd packages/tmdatagrid gallery` serves the gallery alone; `?story=Grid/Default` mounts one story for a manual look.
- The page object is embedded verbatim in [testing.md](packages/tmdatagrid/docs/testing.md) below a `<!-- source: playwright/support/DataGrid.ts -->` marker, and [testingPageObject.test.ts](apps/docs/src/docs/testingPageObject.test.ts) fails when the two drift.
  Change the file, then paste it into the fence.
- [playwright/popup/](playwright/popup) drives the popup demo site in `apps/popup-docs/`: real browser windows, stylesheet copying and Mantine context across windows, which jsdom cannot model at all.
- [playwright/home/](playwright/home) checks the index page in `apps/docs-home/`.
- Every server runs on a fixed port with `--strictPort` (5273 for the grid docs site, 5274 for the gallery, 5275 for the popup demo site, 5276 for the index page), so a `bun run dev` on 5173 never interferes and a taken port fails the run instead of drifting.
- The shared fixtures in [playwright/support/test.ts](playwright/support/test.ts) answer the npm registry and the published site list, and fail a test on any console error.
  Once a page routes any request, Playwright stalls the requests of a scripted about:blank popup, so a popup spec that times stylesheet loads uses the base `test` instead.

## Docs and demos

Grid docs are markdown under [packages/tmdatagrid/docs/](packages/tmdatagrid/docs), registered in [docsPages.ts](apps/docs/src/docs/docsPages.ts) as `@jielga/tmdatagrid/docs/<page>.md?raw` imports.
They stay plain markdown: they ship in the package and the `SKILL.md` files cite them as sources, so no MDX.

The popup window package documents itself in its `README.md`, and `apps/popup-docs/` is a demo site, not a docs renderer.

## Docs sites

Every package has its own docs site, a separate Vite app under `apps/`, and they share a frame rather than a renderer.

- [apps/docs-shell/sites.json](apps/docs-shell/sites.json) is the one list of sites.
  The header's package menu, the index page and the deploy all read it, and the deploy publishes it at the Pages root so a frozen copy of one site still lists packages added after it was built.
- `apps/docs-shell/` (private, `docs-shell`) holds the shared `SiteHeader`: the package menu, the version menu, the GitHub link and the colour scheme switch.
  A site imports its modules by path, `docs-shell/SiteHeader.tsx`, and lists `../docs-shell/src/env.d.ts` in its tsconfig `include`.
- `apps/docs-home/` is the index page at <https://jielga.github.io/react/>.
- A site lives at `/react/<slug>/` and is versioned by the first package it lists: the slug directory serves the newest release, `next/` the tip of `main`, `v<major>.<minor>/` each line, `b/<branch>/` a build published by hand.
  [scripts/docs-plan.mjs](scripts/docs-plan.mjs) decides what a push builds; a release tag is `<name>@<version>`, or `v<version>` from before the packages had their own version lines.
- GitHub Pages serves the root's `404.html` for every missing path.
  That page runs `docs-shell/static/docs-spa-path.js`, which sends a deep link to the copy that owns it, and sends any path under no site to the grid site, which used to be served from the root.
- A back version or a branch preview is published with a `workflow_dispatch` of `deploy-docs.yml`, giving the site, the ref and the slug.

One topic, one page - the option, prop, column meta, callback, CSS variable and the live demo all sit on the page for the thing they belong to.

That rule decides who owns a component's prop table.
A part whose props belong to one topic is written up on that topic's page, in the `## TMDataGrid.X` layout, and [components.md](packages/tmdatagrid/docs/components.md) lists it with a link instead of repeating it.
`components.md` carries the full entry only for what belongs to no single page: the root, the Table, the hooks, and the parts whose props scatter across every topic.
The `## TMDataGrid.X` heading is what marks ownership, so it may appear on one page only - `demos.test.tsx` fails the build otherwise.
Two copies of a prop table drift within one release; that is how `TMDataGrid.FilterPanel` came to read "No props." on one page and list `layout` on another.

Write them as reference documentation for a library, and nothing looser.
State what an option does and what its default is; give a reason only where it changes a decision.
The person using the grid is "the user", the person reading the page is "you", and nobody is "the reader".
No closing flourishes, no design commentary, no jokes.

A demo is one file under `apps/docs/src/examples/demos/` holding code and nothing else: no headings, no prose, nothing you would not paste.
It imports the grid as `@jielga/tmdatagrid`, and its source is shown verbatim.
Prose lives in the docs page that shows it.
Put a demo where the prose explains it with a fence naming the file:

````markdown
```demo
file: rows/Grouping.tsx
hint: “Group by …” lives in every column menu.
```
````

Every demo file must be reachable from exactly one place, a topic or a docs page, and the registry pairs each module with its own source, so adding a demo is adding a file.

`packages/tmdatagrid/skills/*/SKILL.md` cite `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/*.md` by path.
Splitting or renaming a docs page means fixing the `sources:` of every skill that cites it.

## Releasing

Changesets, and a change under a `packages/*/src/` needs one - the pre-commit hook refuses the commit otherwise.
A comment, a test or a refactor with no observable effect is the case for `git commit --no-verify`.

Keep a changeset short: what changed, in a line or a short list.
Reasoning belongs in the code comments; the only thing worth spelling out is a workaround a consumer has to know about.

Each package's `CHANGELOG.md` and the `library_version` in each `SKILL.md` are generated; `bun run version-packages` writes both.
Never edit them by hand.

Nothing publishes from an ordinary push.
Merging the **chore: version packages** PR is the release: `scripts/publish-missing.mjs` packs each public package whose version is missing from the registry with bun and publishes the tarball with npm under trusted publishing.
A new package's first version is published by hand and its trusted-publishing config (repo `Jielga/react`, workflow `release.yml`) added on npmjs.com before the workflow can take it over.

Each published version gets its own git tag and GitHub release named `<name>@<version>`, for example `@jielga/react-popup-window@0.3.0`.
`scripts/publish-missing.mjs` writes `published=<JSON array>` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, one `{ name, version, changelog }` entry per package it published, and the Release workflow loops over it.
The release notes are that version's section of the package's own `CHANGELOG.md`, read by `scripts/changelog-entry.mjs`; a package without a `CHANGELOG.md` gets GitHub's generated notes instead.
A version with a hyphen is marked as a prerelease.
The step is idempotent: an existing tag is not created again, and an existing release is skipped.
The older `v2.x` tags and releases come from when all packages shared one version line, and they stay as history.

## Adding a package

Copy the closest existing package: `packages/tmdatagrid-xlsx` for a package without React, `packages/react-popup-window` for a React package without Mantine, `packages/tmdatagrid` for one with CSS.
Then go through this list; every item has bitten once.

- `package.json`: `name @jielga/<name>`, `repository` with `directory`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `sideEffects`, `files` (`dist`, `src` without tests, docs, `skills` without `_artifacts`), `exports` with `types` first and `./package.json`, `publishConfig.access public`, literal peer ranges, devDependencies from `catalog:`.
- `vite.config.ts` in lib mode with every peer external; `tsconfig.json` extending `tsconfig.base.json`; `tsconfig.build.json` plus `rolldown.dts.config.mjs` flattening the declarations into one `dist/index.d.ts`.
- `vitest.config.ts` with a `name`; the root config picks up `packages/*/vitest.config.ts` and `apps/*/vitest.config.ts` by glob.
- Root wiring by hand: `build:lib` in the root `package.json` (xlsx needs the grid's `dist` first, so order matters) and `references` in the root `tsconfig.json`.
- A site under `apps/` is private, named without the `@jielga/` scope, aliases the package to source, renders `SiteHeader` from `docs-shell`, gets a fixed port with `--strictPort`, a Playwright project and a `webServer` entry, a step in the root `build:docs`, and an entry in `apps/docs-shell/sites.json`.
  The entry is all the deploy needs: it builds every registered site with `bun run --cwd <app> build --base=<path>`.
- At least one `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` whose `sources:` cite `Jielga/react:<repo path>`; `bun run check:skills` validates it.
- Changesets: only a package that must release with another joins a `fixed` group in `.changeset/config.json`; everything else versions on its own.
- Release: build it, `npm publish` the first version by hand from the package directory, add the trusted publisher on npmjs.com, and from then on the Release workflow publishes it.

## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:

- Run `npx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `npx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.
