 * `pre` picks up a border and a radius of its own - stacking a second, rounder
 * outline inside the one `withBorder` already draws - while the `code` loses
 * the shiki background to Typography's `background-color: transparent`.
 *
 * Restating the component's own values as inline styles outranks any sheet, so
 * the block keeps its appearance wherever it is mounted. The values are
 * Mantine's: the `pre` is a bare layout box, and the surface and padding belong

/**
 * Theme and surface together, because contrast is a property of the pair.
 *
 * The theme is named rather than left to Mantine's `light`/`dark` shorthand:
 * the shorthand selects Mantine's own bundled themes, which render comments at
 * #676867 on a #2e2e2e background - 2.4:1, where normal text wants 4.5:1. The
 * adapter only substitutes a bundled theme for the literal strings "light" and
 * "dark", so any other value reaches shiki as a theme name; both are
 * registered in `main.tsx`.
 *
 * The `-default` variants are GitHub's current themes. The older `github-dark`
 * puts comments at #6a737d, 3.9:1 even on its own background - and these demo
 * files are largely comments.
 *
 * The surface goes on twice, because two elements paint one. `bg` covers the
 * root - the tabs variant paints nothing of its own and would let the page show
 * through, which is how a token designed for #0d1117 ended up at 3.2:1 on the
 * page's #242424. `background` sets `--ch-background`, which is what the `code`
 * element and the line-number gutter paint; left at Mantine's gray-0/dark-8
 * default it covers the root with a surface these themes were not measured
 * against. On the surfaces set here the worst token measures 6.2:1 in dark and
 * 4.6:1 in light.
 *
 * `getInitialValueInEffect: false` resolves the scheme during the first render
 * rather than in an effect after it, so a block never paints its light palette
 * on a dark page before correcting itself.
