# TMDataGrid - Grouping and totals

Two independent things: grouping folds the rows into a tree and totals each
category, and the summary row totals everything along the bottom edge.

## Grouping

On by default, and nothing changes until a column is grouped, which users do
from **Group by …** in any column menu. To open already grouped, seed the
state:

```tsx
const grid = useTMDataGrid({
  data,
  columns,
  initialState: { grouping: ["department"] },
});
```

Grouping a column **removes it**, since its values have moved into the tree
lane, and a generated Group column (`GROUP_COLUMN_ID`) appears at the front, pinned
beside the checkbox lane. Each group row shows its value, its record count and a
chevron. Grouping a second column nests.

Because a grouped column is no longer in the grid, **Ungroup** lives on the tree
column's menu, one item per grouped column. `groupedColumnMode: "reorder"`
(TanStack's own default) keeps grouped columns in the grid, moved to the front,
instead of removing them.

## Aggregation

Off by default. A group row leaves every cell blank except the tree lane. Give a
column an `aggregationFn` and its group cells fill in.

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("salary", {
  header: "Salary",
  aggregationFn: "sum",
  aggregatedCell: (info) => <strong>{sek(Number(info.getValue()))}</strong>,
  meta: { type: "number", align: "right" },
});
```

`"sum"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"extent"`, `"mean"`, `"median"`, `"unique"`,
`"uniqueCount"`, `"count"` and `"auto"` are registered, and a function is
accepted too.

TanStack's grouping feature defaults every column to `aggregationFn: "auto"`.
**The grid clears that default**, so grouping does not silently start summing
numeric columns. Setting `"auto"` yourself restores it.

Grouping runs before sorting, so sorting sorts the rows *inside* each group and
orders the groups by their aggregated value. A column with no aggregation has no
value on a group row, so sorting on it reorders rows within each group and
leaves the groups where they are.

## Group rows are not data rows

A group row is built on its first child's record, so passing it to a callback
would pass a row that looks real but is the wrong one. Group rows therefore:

- do not fire `onRowClick` or the cell handlers
- cannot be highlighted, pinned, or given a details panel
- never edit
- are still handed to `rowStyle` and `rowClassName`, with that child's record
  as `original`, so guard a callback reading `original` with
  `row.getIsGrouped()` and colour the group rows with `--dg-row-group-bg`
- carry `data-grouped="true"` and `data-depth`, with `--dg-row-group-bg`
  behind them. `data-grouped` is on every row, `"true"` or `"false"`, so match
  the value rather than the bare attribute

A group row's checkbox selects every record under it at any depth, including
records inside collapsed sub-groups, showing a tick once all are selected and a
dash while only some are. Only the records reach `rowSelection`; a group row is
never in it, so `getSelectedRowModel()` and the toolbar count do not depend on
how the tree is arranged. Under `enableMultiRowSelection: false` group rows carry
no checkbox.

`getGroupDataRows(row)` returns every record under a group row, at any depth.

## Grouping suspends pagination

**Grouping and the built-in pager do not work together, and grouping wins.** As
soon as a column is grouped the grid renders the whole tree and relies on
virtualization. `TMDataGrid.Footer` greys its pager out and replaces the range
with `Grouped · all N rows`. Ungroup and paging resumes where it left off.

This is deliberate. A page can only count one kind of thing, and once the rows
are a tree neither option works: counting every row splits a group across a page
boundary, and counting top-level rows redefines "rows per page" as groups per
page. Rendering the whole tree is the grid's default mode in any case, so only
the pager is lost.

`isPagingActive(table, features)` is exported so a custom pager can grey itself
out the same way. To have both, page on the server: group there and feed the
grid one page of a tree at a time with `manualPagination` and `manualGrouping`.

## The summary row

There is no flag. Give a column a `footer` and the row appears. It exists
whenever at least one visible column defines one.

```tsx
import { aggregateColumn } from "@jielga/tmdatagrid";

columnHelper.accessor("salary", {
  header: "Salary",
  footer: ({ table }) =>
    sek(Number(aggregateColumn({ table, columnId: "salary" }))),
});
```

`footer` is TanStack's own column option, rendered the way the header is.
`aggregateColumn({ table, columnId, fn })` computes over every **filtered** row,
all pages, following the filters live, through the registered aggregation
functions, with `fn` defaulting to `"sum"`.

```tsx
aggregateColumn({ table, columnId: "age", fn: "mean" });
aggregateColumn({ table, columnId: "location", fn: "uniqueCount" });
```

It follows the filters deliberately. A total that does not change as the user
narrows the grid is misleading. Its only argument is `table`, so a toolbar
readout or any other component holding the table reads the same total without a
`footer`.

Pinned columns keep their lanes in the summary row, the generated lanes define
no `footer` so their cells stay blank, and the row is sticky at
`--dg-summary-height`.

## Common mistakes

### CRITICAL Expecting group rows to total automatically

Grouping alone leaves every cell blank on a group row, because the grid clears
TanStack's `aggregationFn: "auto"` default. Nothing errors; the tree just looks
empty.

Wrong:

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("salary", { header: "Salary" });
```

Correct:

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("salary", { header: "Salary", aggregationFn: "sum" });
```

Source: `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/grouping.md` (Aggregation).

### HIGH Looking for the grouped column in the grid

`groupedColumnMode` defaults to `"remove"`, so grouping by Department takes the
Department column out, since its values are in the tree lane. Code that reads
that column's cells, or a test that queries its header, stops finding it as soon
as a user groups.

Correct, when the column must stay:

```tsx
useTMDataGrid({ data, columns, groupedColumnMode: "reorder" });
```

Source: `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/grouping.md` (What grouping does to the grid).

### HIGH Combining the pager with grouping

`enablePagination: true` and a grouped column cannot both apply. The pager greys
out instead of paging the tree, so a footer count wired to `getPageCount()`
reports a number nobody can navigate to. Read
`isPagingActive(table, features)` before trusting the pager state.

Source: `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/grouping.md` (Grouping suspends pagination).

### HIGH Handing a group row to a row callback

Group rows do not fire `onRowClick` or the cell handlers, and cannot be pinned,
expanded or edited. Their `row.original` is an arbitrary child's record, so a
bulk action built from `row.original` on the tree lane acts on one record
instead of the group. `rowStyle` and `rowClassName` are the callbacks group
rows do reach, so one reading `row.original` colours the group by whichever
child came first.

Correct:

```tsx
import { getGroupDataRows } from "@jielga/tmdatagrid";

const records = getGroupDataRows(groupRow).map((row) => row.original);

<TMDataGrid.Table<Employee>
  rowStyle={(row) =>
    !row.getIsGrouped() && row.original.status === "Terminated"
      ? { "--row-bg": "color-mix(in srgb, var(--mantine-color-red-6) 12%, transparent)" }
      : undefined
  }
/>;
```

Source: `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/grouping.md` (Group rows are not data rows).

### MEDIUM Totalling the page instead of the data

`aggregateColumn` deliberately runs over every filtered row, all pages. Summing
`table.getRowModel().rows` instead totals only what is currently paged in, and
under virtualization not even that: only the mounted rows.

Source: `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/summary-row.md` (Totalling a column).

### MEDIUM Grouping a server-paged grid

`manualPagination: true` turns grouping off, because the client holds one page
and would build groups out of an arbitrary slice. Group on the server and
declare it.

Correct:

```tsx
useTMDataGrid({
  data: page.rows,
  columns,
  manualPagination: true,
  manualGrouping: true,
  enableGrouping: true,
});
```

Source: `packages/tmdatagrid/docs/grouping.md` (Server-side grids).
