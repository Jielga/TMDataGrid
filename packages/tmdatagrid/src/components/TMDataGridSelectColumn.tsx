 * component - but the body cell above it keeps the same props across a
 * selection change (row, column and layout identities all survive it), so the
 * React Compiler reuses the memoized element and the subtree never re-renders.
 * The row highlight would update, from state `TMDataGridTable` subscribes to,
 * while the box below it stayed unchecked.
 *
 * Selection is derived inside the selector, not from a method call in the
 * component body, for the same reason: `table` and `row` identities survive the
 * change, so a call in the body would be cached along with them.
