# Areas

An area is a filled region, such as a county, a sales district or a nature reserve.
Areas are drawn over the land, and under the lakes, the coastline, the roads and the pins.
Pass them in `areas`, each with an `id` and a GeoJSON `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` in WGS 84 degrees:

```tsx
const district: MapArea = {
  id: "north",
  label: "District North",
  fill: "rgb(214 51 108 / 30%)",
  geometry: { type: "Polygon", coordinates: [[[17, 63], [20, 63], [20, 65], [17, 65], [17, 63]]] },
};

<NordicMap source={swedenOsmSource} areas={[district]} />;
```

Rings may run either way round.

## Counties and municipalities

The package has Sweden's 21 counties and 290 municipalities as areas, clipped to the land:

- `loadSwedenCounties()` - each `id` is the county code from Statistics Sweden, such as `"01"` for Stockholms län
- `loadSwedenMunicipalities()` - each `id` is the municipality code, such as `"0180"` for Stockholm, and starts with its county's code

Each `label` is the area's name.
The files load on the first call, about 150 kB and 250 kB compressed, and later calls share them.
Neighbouring areas share their borders exactly.

## Choropleth map

To color each area by a value, set its `fill`:

```demo
file: areas/CountyChoropleth.tsx
hint: Point at a county for its name, and click it for its population.
height: 520
extraSources: data/countyPopulation.ts
```

## Hover and click

`onAreaHover` is called when the pointer moves onto an area, and with `null` when it leaves.
`onAreaClick` is called when an area is clicked; the click also reaches `onMapClick`.
The hovered area has an outline in `mapStyle.highlight`:

```demo
file: areas/Municipalities.tsx
hint: Click municipalities to pick them.
height: 520
```

Changing an area's `fill` does not project it again, as long as its `geometry` object stays the same.
