# TMDataGrid - Grouping and totals

Two independent things: grouping folds the rows into a tree and totals each
category, and the summary row totals everything along the bottom edge.

## Grouping

On by default, and nothing changes until a column is grouped - the reader does
that from **Group by …** in any column menu. To open already grouped, seed the
state:

```tsx
const grid = useTMDataGrid({
  data,
  columns,
  initialState: { grouping: ["department"] },
});
```

Grouping a column **removes it** - its values have moved into the tree lane -
and a generated Group column (`GROUP_COLUMN_ID`) appears at the front, pinned
beside the checkbox lane. Each group row shows its value, its record count and a
chevron. Grouping a second column nests.

Because a grouped column is no longer in the grid, **Ungroup** lives on the tree
column's menu, one item per grouped column. `groupedColumnMode: "reorder"`
(TanStack's own default) keeps grouped columns in the grid, moved to the front,
instead of removing them.

## Aggregation

Off unless asked for. A grouped grid is a tree, not a summary: a group row
leaves every cell blank except the tree lane. Give a column an `aggregationFn`
and it fills in.

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("salary", {
  header: "Salary",
  aggregationFn: "sum",
  aggregatedCell: (info) => <strong>{sek(Number(info.getValue()))}</strong>,
  meta: { type: "number", align: "right" },
});
```

`"sum"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"extent"`, `"mean"`, `"median"`, `"unique"`,
`"uniqueCount"`, `"count"` and `"auto"` are registered, and a function is
accepted too.

TanStack's grouping feature defaults every column to `aggregationFn: "auto"`.
**The grid clears that default**, so grouping does not silently start summing
numeric columns. Setting `"auto"` yourself restores it.

Grouping runs before sorting, so sorting sorts the rows *inside* each group and
orders the groups by their aggregated value. A column with no aggregation has no
value on a group row, so sorting on it reorders rows within each group and
leaves the groups where they are.

## Group rows are not data rows

A group row is built on its first child's record, so handing it to a callback
would hand over a real-looking row that is the wrong one. Group rows therefore:

- do not fire `onRowClick` or the cell handlers
- cannot be highlighted, pinned, or given a details panel
- never edit
- carry `data-grouped` and `data-depth`, with `--dg-row-group-bg` behind them

A group row's checkbox selects every record under it at any depth, including
records inside collapsed sub-groups, showing a tick once all are selected and a
dash while only some are. Only the records reach `rowSelection` - a group row is
never in it - so `getSelectedRowModel()` and the toolbar count are unaffected by
how the tree is arranged. Under `enableMultiRowSelection: false` group rows carry
no checkbox.

`getGroupDataRows(row)` returns every record under a group row, at any depth.

## Grouping suspends pagination

**Grouping and the built-in pager do not work together, and grouping wins.** As
soon as a column is grouped the grid renders the whole tree and relies on
virtualization; `TMDataGrid.Footer` greys its pager out and replaces the range
with `Grouped · all N rows`. Ungroup and paging resumes where it left off.

This is deliberate. A page can only count one kind of thing, and once the rows
are a tree neither answer is usable: counting every row splits a group across a
page boundary, and counting top-level rows quietly redefines "rows per page" as
groups per page. Rendering the whole tree is the grid's default mode anyway -
pagination is the opt-in - so nothing is lost but the pager.

`isPagingActive(table, features)` is exported so a custom pager can grey itself
out the same way. To have both, page on the server: group there and feed the
grid one page of a tree at a time with `manualPagination` and `manualGrouping`.

## The summary row

There is no flag. Give a column a `footer` and the row appears; it exists
exactly when at least one visible column defines one.

```tsx
import { aggregateColumn } from "@jielga/tmdatagrid";

columnHelper.accessor("salary", {
  header: "Salary",
  footer: ({ table }) =>
    sek(Number(aggregateColumn({ table, columnId: "salary" }))),
});
```

`footer` is TanStack's own column option, rendered the way the header is.
`aggregateColumn({ table, columnId, fn })` computes over every **filtered** row -
all pages, following the filters live - through the registered aggregation
functions, with `fn` defaulting to `"sum"`.

```tsx
aggregateColumn({ table, columnId: "age", fn: "mean" });
aggregateColumn({ table, columnId: "location", fn: "uniqueCount" });
```

Following the filters is the point: a footer that keeps saying the same number
while the reader narrows the grid looks like it is answering the question in
front of them when it is not.

Pinned columns keep their lanes in the summary row, the generated lanes define
no `footer` so their cells stay blank, and the row is sticky at
`--dg-summary-height`.

## Common mistakes

### CRITICAL Expecting group rows to total automatically

Grouping alone leaves every cell blank on a group row, because the grid clears
TanStack's `aggregationFn: "auto"` default. Nothing errors - the tree simply
looks empty, which reads as a broken feature.

Wrong:

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("salary", { header: "Salary" });
```

Correct:

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("salary", { header: "Salary", aggregationFn: "sum" });
```

Source: `src/docs/grouping.md` (Aggregation).

### HIGH Looking for the grouped column in the grid

`groupedColumnMode` defaults to `"remove"`, so grouping by Department takes the
Department column out - its values are in the tree lane. Code that reads that
column's cells, or a test that queries its header, stops finding it the moment a
reader groups.

Correct, when the column must stay:

```tsx
useTMDataGrid({ data, columns, groupedColumnMode: "reorder" });
```

Source: `src/docs/grouping.md` (What grouping does to the grid).

### HIGH Combining the pager with grouping

`enablePagination: true` and a grouped column cannot both be honoured. The pager
greys out rather than paging the tree, so a footer count wired to
`getPageCount()` reports a number nobody can navigate to. Read
`isPagingActive(table, features)` before trusting the pager state.

Source: `src/docs/grouping.md` (Grouping suspends pagination).

### HIGH Handing a group row to a row callback

Group rows sit out `onRowClick`, the cell handlers, pinning, details and
editing, and their `row.original` is an arbitrary child's record. A bulk action
built from `row.original` on the tree lane acts on one record instead of the
group.

Correct:

```tsx
import { getGroupDataRows } from "@jielga/tmdatagrid";

const records = getGroupDataRows(groupRow).map((row) => row.original);
```

Source: `src/docs/grouping.md` (Group rows are not data rows).

### MEDIUM Totalling the page instead of the data

`aggregateColumn` deliberately runs over every filtered row, all pages. Summing
`table.getRowModel().rows` instead totals only what is currently paged in, which
matches the screen but answers a different question - and under virtualization
it is not even the whole page.

Source: `src/docs/summary-row.md` (Totalling a column).

### MEDIUM Grouping a server-paged grid

`manualPagination: true` turns grouping off: the client holds one page and would
build groups out of an arbitrary slice. Group on the server and declare it.

Correct:

```tsx
useTMDataGrid({
  data: page.rows,
  columns,
  manualPagination: true,
  manualGrouping: true,
  enableGrouping: true,
});
```

Source: `src/docs/grouping.md` (Server-side grids).
