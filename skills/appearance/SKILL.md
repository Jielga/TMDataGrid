# TMDataGrid - Appearance, toolbar and labels

Everything set on the grid element or composed around it: the size scale, the
CSS variables, the toolbar, and the strings.

## Size

`size` drives row height, header height, font size and cell padding together,
and selects the size of every Mantine control the grid renders.

| `size` | Row height | Header height | Font size | Cell padding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xs` | 34px | 32px | `xs` | 6px |
| `sm` | 42px | 38px | `sm` | 8px |
| `md` (default) | 52px | 44px | `sm` | 10px |
| `lg` | 62px | 52px | `md` | 14px |
| `xl` | 72px | 60px | `lg` | 18px |

Row height is also required by the virtualizer **as a number**, so it cannot be
defined in CSS alone. For a height outside the scale, set `meta.rowHeight`
rather than the variable. `SIZE_ROW_HEIGHT` is the exported source of these
values.

## CSS variables

`style` accepts custom properties and `className` reaches the same element from
a stylesheet. Both are per instance, so a grid can be themed without a
provider.

```tsx
<TMDataGrid
  {...grid}
  size="sm"
  style={{ "--dg-row-selected-bg": "var(--mantine-color-blue-0)" }}
/>
```

**Metrics:** `--dg-row-height`, `--dg-header-height`, `--dg-summary-height`,
`--dg-entry-height`, `--dg-font-size`, `--dg-padding`. All default from `size`.
The generated lanes are excluded from padding: they are fixed 36px tracks that
centre their control.

**Colours:** `--row-bg` (one row's own background; set this, never
`background`), `--dg-row-selected-bg`, `--dg-row-highlight-bg`,
`--dg-row-striped-bg`, `--dg-row-group-bg`, `--dg-match-highlight-bg`,
`--dg-header-shadow-color`.

**Layout internals:** `--dg-sticky-edge-range` (`20px`), the `--dg-edge-*`
markers the grid sets on cell-range borders, and the `--dg-z-*` stacking order.
Change those only to place something of your own between two layers.

One stylesheet import, once, anywhere:

```tsx
import "@jielga/tmdatagrid/styles.css";
```

`@jielga/tmdatagrid/styles.layer.css` is the same stylesheet wrapped in a
`@layer`, for an application that orders its own layers. Import **one** of the
two, never both.

## Layout

The grid fills the box you give it and scrolls inside it. It does not size
itself to its content, because a virtualized grid has no content height to
measure.

```tsx
<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", height: "100vh" }}>
  <TMDataGrid {...grid} style={{ flex: 1, minHeight: 0 }}>
    <TMDataGrid.Table />
  </TMDataGrid>
</div>
```

`minHeight: 0` is required: a flex item's default `min-height: auto` will not
shrink below its content, so without it the grid grows past the viewport instead
of scrolling.

## Toolbar

The toolbar is a flex row. There is no slots API and no `actions` prop: your
buttons sit beside the built-in ones because they are all children of the same
element, and `TMDataGrid.Spacer` pushes what follows to the right.

```tsx
<TMDataGrid.Toolbar>
  <TMDataGrid.SummaryCount />
  <TMDataGrid.Search />
  <TMDataGrid.Spacer />
  <TMDataGrid.LoadingIndicator />
  <ExportButton />
  <TMDataGrid.FilterButton />
  <TMDataGrid.Menu>
    <TMDataGrid.Menu.Columns />
  </TMDataGrid.Menu>
</TMDataGrid.Toolbar>
```

Each built-in renders nothing when its feature is off, so a read-only grid needs
no conditionals: `FilterButton` under `enableColumnFilters: false` renders
nothing at all.

### The grid menu

`TMDataGrid.Menu` is the burger: a Mantine `Menu` whose children are the
dropdown, so your own `Menu.Item`s sit beside the built-in items. It takes
Mantine `MenuProps` (defaults `position="bottom-end"`, `shadow="md"`,
`width={260}`, `withinPortal`), `icon` and `label` (default `labels.menuButton`).

```tsx
import { Menu } from "@mantine/core";

<TMDataGrid.Menu>
  <Menu.Item onClick={exportCsv}>Export CSV</Menu.Item>
  <Menu.Divider />
  <Menu.Label>Columns</Menu.Label>
  <TMDataGrid.Menu.Columns />
</TMDataGrid.Menu>
```

`TMDataGrid.Menu.Columns` is the column chooser as menu items: `Menu.Search`,
one checkbox item per hideable column, show/hide all and reset layout;
it renders nothing when no column can be hidden. Its pieces
`TMDataGrid.Menu.ColumnToggles` (`search` narrows the list),
`.ShowHideAll` and `.ResetLayout` are exported for menus that want only some of
them. Every piece needs a Mantine `Menu` around it and reads the grid from
context, so it works in any Mantine menu rendered inside `TMDataGrid`, and in a
`Menu.Sub` (pass `searchable={false}` there: `Menu.Search` registers on the
root menu and switches off its type-ahead and arrow keys).

The menu always renders, since it cannot see what its children render; a menu
holding only `Menu.Columns` should be hidden with `canHideAny` under
`enableHiding: false`. `TMDataGrid.ColumnsPanel` is the same chooser as plain
controls, for a Popover, a Drawer or an inline layout.

A button of your own reads the grid from context, which returns
`{ table, ui, features, labels, controlSize, resetSettings }`:

```tsx
import {
  exportGridToCsv,
  getGridCapabilities,
  useTMDataGridContext,
} from "@jielga/tmdatagrid";

function ExportButton() {
  const { table, features, controlSize } = useTMDataGridContext();
  const { canFilterAny } = getGridCapabilities(table, features);

  if (!canFilterAny) return null;

  return (
    <Button size={controlSize} onClick={() => exportGridToCsv({ table })}>
      Export
    </Button>
  );
}
```

`getGridCapabilities(table, features)` returns `canSortAny`, `canFilterAny`,
`canHideAny`, `canPinAny`, `canReorderAny`, `canGroupAny`, `canSelectRows`,
`canPaginate` and `canSearch`. `getColumnCapabilities(column, features)` returns
the same for one column as `canSort`, `canFilter`, `canHide`, `canPin`,
`canResize`, `canReorder` and `canGroup`.

### Why `features` is a second argument

`features` comes back from `useTMDataGrid` and is re-derived from the options
object on every render. It is required **in addition to** TanStack's `getCanX()`
methods because it is what makes the result reactive. `column.getCanSort()` is a
method call on a column object whose identity survives an options change, so
under the React Compiler that call is memoized and a grid whose `enableSorting`
changed to `false` would carry on rendering sort indicators. `features` supplies
a value that changes; `getCanX()` still decides the outcome.

The same rule applies elsewhere in your application: read state through
`useSelector(table.store, …)` and options through `features`, rather than
calling methods on a long-lived object.

## Labels

Every string the grid renders, and every `aria-label`, comes from one labels
object. English by default, and `labels` takes **any subset**, merged over the
defaults.

```tsx
import { TMDATAGRID_LABELS_SV } from "@jielga/tmdatagrid";

const grid = useTMDataGrid({ data, columns, labels: TMDATAGRID_LABELS_SV });
```

Labels that carry a value are functions, so each language can place the value
where its grammar requires:

```tsx
const labels = {
  groupBy: (column) => `Gruppera på ${column}`,
  pageRange: ({ from, to, total }) => `${from}–${to} av ${total}`,
} satisfies TMDataGridLabelsOverride;
```

`TMDataGridLabels` is the full dictionary type, so a missing key in a new
translation is a compile error. The resolved dictionary comes back as
`grid.labels` and from `useTMDataGridContext().labels`, so a component of your
own uses the same strings as the built-in parts.

## Common mistakes

### CRITICAL Importing both stylesheets

`styles.css` and `styles.layer.css` are the same rules, one wrapped in a
`@layer`. Importing both means the unlayered copy wins every cascade contest,
so an application that ordered its layers to put the grid underneath its own
overrides silently gets the opposite.

Source: `src/docs/styling.md` (The stylesheet).

### CRITICAL A grid with no bounded height

The grid does not size itself to its content, so inside a flex parent without
`minHeight: 0` it grows past the viewport and the page scrolls instead of the
body. Rows render, so nothing looks broken until the list is long.

Wrong:

```tsx
<TMDataGrid {...grid} style={{ flex: 1 }} />
```

Correct:

```tsx
<TMDataGrid {...grid} style={{ flex: 1, minHeight: 0 }} />
```

Source: `src/docs/styling.md` (Layout).

### HIGH Setting `--dg-row-height` to change density

The virtualizer needs the row height as a number, and takes it from
`meta.rowHeight` or `size`, not from the variable. Setting the variable alone
leaves the measurement and the render disagreeing, so rows overlap or gaps open
as you scroll.

Correct:

```tsx
useTMDataGrid({ data, columns, meta: { rowHeight: 64 } });
```

Source: `src/docs/styling.md` (The size scale).

### HIGH A capability check without `features`

`getGridCapabilities` and `getColumnCapabilities` both take `features` as a
second argument because it is the value that changes. Calling
`column.getCanSort()` directly in a custom header or toolbar button memoizes
against the column identity under the React Compiler, and the control keeps
rendering after its option was switched off.

Wrong:

```tsx
if (!column.getCanSort()) return null;
```

Correct:

```tsx
const { canSort } = getColumnCapabilities(column, features);
if (!canSort) return null;
```

Source: `src/docs/toolbar.md` (Why `features` is a second argument).

### MEDIUM An inline `labels` object

The grid re-renders when the labels object changes identity, and an inline
literal is a new object on every render. Define it at module scope, or memoize
it.

Wrong:

```tsx
useTMDataGrid({ data, columns, labels: { noResults: "Inga träffar" } });
```

Correct:

```tsx
const labels = { noResults: "Inga träffar" } satisfies TMDataGridLabelsOverride;

useTMDataGrid({ data, columns, labels });
```

Source: `src/docs/localization.md` (Keep the object stable).

### MEDIUM Conditionally rendering built-in toolbar parts

Each built-in already renders nothing when its feature is off. Wrapping them in
your own checks duplicates the capability logic, and the two drift apart the
first time an option changes.

Source: `src/docs/toolbar.md` (The built-in parts).
